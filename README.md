# Shark-Attack-Project
Mini project for my Ironhack Bootcamp. Worked in tandem with Aida García and Javier Gómez.

For this project, we were given a dataset of shark attacks ( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/felipeesc/shark-attack-dataset ).

I have made a simple Trello board to organize my work. You can acces it here: https://trello.com/invite/b/LhumaINS/ATTI3460e692fa53404294b97027a64a82bb1226520A/workflow

The main question to answer was: Are the shark attacks more prone to be fatal or non-fatal?

This dataset is a great way to practice data cleaning,as almost everything in it needed cleaning. It was a lot of work and a lot of proof checking, but it is really exciting to see the final dataset cleaned and ready to be worked with.
